import UIKit

// ---- Arrays
// --- Arrays are useful whenever you need to keep track of an ordered list of things. This is similar to how we keep track of lists in the real world.


// ---- Initialize an empty array for Strings and Integars
var arrayOfInt = [Int]()
var arrayOfStrings = [String]()







// ---- Accessing Array index

var friendsOfKarlie = ["Michelle Obama", "Serena Williams", "T Swift", "Jimmy Fallon", "Eric Smith"]

// ---- update a piece of the array

friendsOfKarlie[4] = "Marnie"
friendsOfKarlie



// ---- Add information to the array using append
friendsOfKarlie.append("John Mayer")


// ---- Remove information from the array
friendsOfKarlie.remove(at: 0)


// ---- Try It: Creating Arrays and Accessing Data

// ---- Create an array of 3 of your role models and/or friends, and store it in a variable. Then, take these steps:

var friends = ["John", "Maggie", "Rebecca"]

// ----- Access the second person using [] notation

friends[1]

// ----- Add another person to the list

friends.append("Robert")

// ----- Change one of the people

friends[0] = "Rachel"

// ----- Remove the person from the array

friends.remove(at: 3)

// ----- Iterating Over Elements in an Array Example

var friendsOfKarlie1 = ["Michelle Obama", "Serena Williams", "T Swift", "Jimmy Fallon"]

for thing in friendsOfKarlie1 {
    print("Hi \(thing)!")
}



for friend in friendsOfKarlie1 {
    print("hi \(friend)!")
}



// ---- Practice: Arrays

// ---- Part 1: Hobbies

// ----- Create an array of your top five favorite hobbies

var hobbies = ["Skiing", "Yoga", "Cooking", "Drumming", "Swimming"]

// ----- Change at least one of the values in the array

hobbies[0] = "Scuba Diving"

// ------ Add a new hobby to the array

hobbies.append("Sledding")

// ------ Remove the second hobby from the array

hobbies.remove(at: 1)

// ------ Print the value of the third element of the array

print(hobbies[2])
print(hobbies)
// ----- You should have five hobbies in your array. Using a for-in loop and string interpolation, iterate over the values in your array in order to print five strings that say "I love ______!"

for hobby in hobbies {
    print("I love \(hobby)")
}


//// DICTIONARIES
//Try It: Array or Dictionary?
//For each set of data, would an array or dictionary be better to store it? Why?

//List of all of the students in class - array
//List of states and their capitals - dictionary
//List of things to pack for vacation - array
//Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - array
//List of students and their birthdays - dictionary

//Try It: Creating and Accessing Dictionaries
//Create a dictionary with a list of 3 people (yourself, family, friends, or other students here!) and their birthdays.
//Use print() statements to verify your syntax is correct.

// initialize your dictionary for family:

var people : [String : String] = [:]


// create dictionary

var family = [
    "Uncle" : "Richard",
    "Aunt" : "Michelle",
    "Sister" : "Madeleine",
    "Mom" : "Suzanne"
]

// print dictionary
print(family)

// intialize new dictionary
var fruitColors : [String : String] = [:]

fruitColors["Apple"] = "Green"
fruitColors["Banana"] = "Yellow"
fruitColors["Orange"] = "Orange"

print(fruitColors)


//To tell Swift we are sure there is data, we do something called unwrapping - by typing an exclamation point after the closing bracket.

print(fruitColors["Apple"]!)
print(fruitColors["Orange"]!)

//Set value to nil
fruitColors["Banana"]
fruitColors["Banana"] = nil
print(fruitColors)




//print(people2["Banana"]!)

print(people2.keys)
print(Array(people2.keys))


//Practice: Dictionaries
//Friend/Family Tree
//Create a dictionary with keys that are family or friend titles (i.e. "sister", "bestFriend") and values that are the name of that family member or friend. Pets are family, too!

//Aim to have at least 10 family members of friends in your 'tree'
//Print to the console the entire dictionary

var family : [String : String] = [:]

family = [
    "Sister" : "Madeleine",
    "Mom" : "Suzanne",
    "Dad" : "Tom",
    "Uncle" : "Richard",
    "Aunt1" : "Michelle",
    "Aunt2" : "Deb",
    "Grandfather" : "Richard",
    "Cousin1" : "Will",
    "Cousin2" : "Thomas",
    "Cousin3" : "Andrew"
    
]

print(family)

//Print to the console 3 individual names

print(family["Sister"]!)
print(family["Mom"]!)
print(family["Dad"]!)

//Remove someone from your tree ðŸ˜” (You can add them back if you want!)

family["Uncle"] = nil
print(family)

//Extension: Nested Collections
//Create a dictionary in which the keys are strings and the values are arrays of strings. This is called a _nested_ collection, because it has collections inside of a collection.
//
//Need ideas for topics?
//
//    Re-write your family tree with arrays (it's ok to only have 1 item in some arrays). This will make keeping track of cousins easier in some cases!
//    Keys: dogs, cats, dinosaurs. Values: ["German Shepard", "Shih-Tzu", "Great Dane"], etc.
