//Practice: Loops
//Check Your Understanding
//Let's take some time to answer the following questions in our journals, and then discuss our answers together.

//What is a for-in loop (in Swift)? What does it do?
    // It repeats a command over an array, dictionary, or sequences of repetitions to carry out a task.
//What are the different ways you can use a for-in loop?
    //Do repetitive print statements, calculations over many data types
//How can for-in loops be useful? What do you think is the point of them?
//Can you brainstorm some ways that one of your favorite apps might make use of a for-in loop?
//    Modify your friends names
//    Can you use the for-in loop to edit the strings in your friends array from just their names to their names plus an exclamation point? Consider:
//
//how to access an element in an array based on its index
//how to tell your for-in loop to run for the same number of times as the length of your array
//how to assign a new value to an element in an array
//how to add strings together

for index in 0..<friends.count {
    let friends_new = (friends[index] + "!")
    print(friends_new)
}

for index in 0..<10 {
    print("Hello")
}
